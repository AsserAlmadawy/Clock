# Clock Project

## Description

A responsive website which contains two clocks; one is a digital clock and the other is an analog clock. Above the analog clock, there is a button which is written inside it "Dark Mode". When you click it, the website's background color changes into black with a transition and the text which is written inside the button changes into "Light Mode".
